# DETECTION-OF-MANIPULATED-PRICING-IN-SMART-ENERGY-CPS-SCHEDULING
In this coursework, we are given the data of a small community with 5 people and 10 smart home appliances each. Each person is also given 10 tasks to use the smart appliances and requires them to schedule their usage. We are also given 10000 labelled training data which contains the pricing for each hour of the day and its corresponding label (normal or abnormal). Using this data, a model needs to be built to effectively classify the scheduling data into normal and abnormal (i.e., effectively predicting a pricing attack). We are also given 100 pricing curves for the grid as testing data without labels that needs to be classified using the built model. On classifying a price curve as abnormal, we need to minimize the cost by building a Linear Programming solution according to the abnormal price guideline. This minimized cost schedule will give the normal scheduling for each abnormal price curve.
